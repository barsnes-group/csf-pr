# CSF-PR
CSF Proteome Resource is an online repository of mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments on human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The resource contains structured and handled  proteomics data based on mass spectrometry from studies focused on biomarker discovery and verification for multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,  Alzheimer's  disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
The System supports the search, exploration, and comparison of quantitative mass spectrometry data on the Resource and is freely available through  CSF-PR (http://probe.uib.no/csf-pr)
